# Media Match
### A React-native application

Rate news articles true or false. Media Match is built with React-Native and Firebase and it pulls articles from Reddit.

If you want to suggest a subreddit to pull news from, please send a PR! The subreddits should only allow links to news articles. This has limited the selection of subreddits somewhat and left out parts of the spectrum that does not have a dedicated subreddit for news articles.

This app is not biased towards or against any opinion, position or publication, political or otherwise, and anyone can confirm this by viewing all of the source code.

Contact me at *dunderfeltdaniel@gmail.com* for questions or comments about this app. Please file an issue or a PR if you've found a bug or want to suggest a new feature.
