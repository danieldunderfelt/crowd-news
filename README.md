Judge news articles REAL or FAKE. Media Match is built with React-Native and Firebase and it pulls articles from Reddit.

If you want to suggest a subreddit to pull news from, please send a PR! The subreddits should only allow links to news articles. You can also submit articles to [/r/mediamatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/mediamatch/) which is one of the included subreddits.

This app is not biased towards or against any opinion, position or publication, political or otherwise.
